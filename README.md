# Preconditions:

- Have AWS CLI installed
- Have Terraform Cli installed
- Have AWS account credentials exported/configured with sufficient rights to create and destroy stuff

# How to start using terraform with s3 backend

## Steps:

1. Make sure you're making changes to the right AWS account. Execute this command to see who you are authenticated as

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

2. Change aws region and bucket name to what you need.

- Open `./main.tf`
- Change `aws-region` in `locals` to the region you want
- Change `terraform_state_bucket_name` to the bucket name that makes sense for your project. **Bucket name must be unique across all of AWS**
- Change `region` and `bucket` in `backend` configuration a few lines above to match the values you just set in `locals`. Keep backend configuration commented out for now

3. Terraform init for the first time

```
terraform init
```

4. Terraform apply to create s3 bucket, dynamodb table and a secret in KMS for encypting data in s3

```
terraform apply

-> Do you want to perform these actions?
yes
```

5.  Uncomment the s3 backend provider code in `./main.tf`, cause now we created all infrastructure to be able to switch to new backend

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }

  backend "s3" {
    region         = "eu-central-1"
    bucket         = "terraform-state-for-my-org"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
    kms_key_id     = "alias/terraform-bucket-key"

    key     = "org-shared-state/terraform.tfstate"
    encrypt = true
  }
}
```

6.  Terraform init once again cause we're using new backend

```
terraform init

-> Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
yes
```

7. Just as a test, do terraform apply and see 0 changes

```
terraform apply
```

# How to destroy the infrastructure (s3 + dynamodb) without messing things up

1. Comment out the backend configuration in `./main.tf`

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }

  # backend "s3" {
  #   region         = "eu-central-1"
  #   bucket         = "terraform-state-for-my-org"
  #   dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  #   kms_key_id     = "alias/terraform-bucket-key"

  #   key     = "org-shared-state/terraform.tfstate"
  #   encrypt = true
  # }
}
```

2. Move state from s3 backend to local backend

```
terraform init -migrate-state

-> Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
yes
```

3. Make the s3 bucket that stores state as destroyable

In `./backend/main.tf` change `prevent_destroy = true` to `prevent_destroy = false` in s3 bucket resource

4. Delete all content of all versions in the bucket.

You have 2 options:

a) via AWS console, go to s3, select the bucket and click `EMPTY BUCKET`

b) via AWS CLI:

Run the command after
**replacing `<YOUR BUCKET NAME>` with your bucket name in 2 places**.

```
aws s3api delete-objects --bucket <YOUR BUCKET NAME> \
  --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions \
  --bucket "<YOUR BUCKET NAME>" \
  --output=json \
  --query='{Objects: Versions[].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId}}')"
```

5. Run terraform destroy

```
terraform destroy

-> Do you really want to destroy all resources?
yes
```
